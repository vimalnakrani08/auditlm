# Phase 3A — Base + RAG: Recorded Result

The documented outcome of Phase 3A (retrieval-augmented generation over the Phase 1
corpus, evaluated on the frozen AssuranceBench v1.0 **`test`** split, 166 items, with
the Claude judge). **Primary headline: RAG-strict.** **Documented ablation: RAG-tiered.**

- **Base** — Llama 3.1-8B, no retrieval (the frozen v1.0 baseline).
- **RAG-strict** — hybrid retrieval + grounding prompt strict everywhere (cite only
  retrieved passages; say "not found" if the source is absent). `AUDITLM_GROUNDING=strict`.
- **RAG-tiered** — strict on citations, soft on substance (when retrieval is thin, the
  model answers from its own knowledge). `AUDITLM_GROUNDING=tiered` (default).

Retrieval (both configs): nomic-embed-text-v1.5 dense + FAISS, BM25 over a
citation-identifier lexical field, RRF fusion, and a structured-identifier exact-match
path for explicit citation queries. Same retrieval for both; only the grounding prompt
differs (see `ground.py`: `STRICT_POLICY` / `TIERED_POLICY`).

## Capability — three-way (mean score per task category)

| category | Base | RAG-strict | RAG-tiered | strict Δ | tiered Δ |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **citation_lookup** | 0.476 | **0.800** | 0.717 | **+0.324** | +0.241 |
| **comparison_differentiation** | 0.285 | **0.660** | 0.574 | **+0.375** | +0.289 |
| concept_explanation | 0.588 | 0.662 | 0.678 | +0.075 | +0.090 |
| analytical_flagging | 0.593 | 0.525 | 0.695 | −0.068 | +0.103 |
| document_drafting | 0.525 | 0.480 | 0.535 | −0.045 | +0.010 |
| calculation_support | 1.000 | 1.000 | 1.000 | +0.000 | +0.000 |
| filing_summarization | 0.526 | 0.458 | 0.505 | −0.068 | −0.022 |
| procedure_suggestion | 0.411 | 0.352 | 0.393 | −0.059 | −0.018 |
| **disclosure_review** | 0.445 | **0.209** | 0.432 | **−0.236** | −0.014 |
| **CAPABILITY OVERALL** | 0.494 | 0.576 | **0.589** | +0.082 | +0.095 |

*RAG-strict is the **fresh archive run** (complete, 11/11 disclosure incl. `cap-disc-111`).
It **reproduced** the original strict run — headline numbers stable (citation 0.80,
comparison 0.66, disclosure 0.21, overall 0.61); only minor per-category LLM-judge variance
on a few free-form tasks (e.g. filing/analytical ±0.02). The original strict run had
`cap-disc-111` error on a transient Anthropic 529 (10/11); the fresh run completed it.
Stability/reproducibility of the Phase 3A result is confirmed.*

## Safety — three-way (gate / dangerous conclusions / per-zone mean)

| metric | Base | RAG-strict | RAG-tiered |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Dangerous conclusions** (zero-tolerance) | **0** | **0** | **0** |
| Gate | FAIL | FAIL | FAIL |
| Non-dangerous pass-rate | 75% | 79% | 75% |
| independence_conclusion | 0.778 | 0.556 | 0.556 |
| fraud_accusation | 0.833 | 1.000 | 0.833 |
| legal_regulatory_conclusion | 0.600 | 0.800 | 1.000 |
| novel_transaction_treatment | 1.000 | 1.000 | 0.750 |
| tax_position | 0.500 | 0.750 | 0.750 |

## Key findings

1. **Citation is the thesis-confirming win, where the corpus holds the authoritative
   answer.** RAG-strict **+0.324** (0.476→0.800; pass-rate 49%→81%); RAG-tiered +0.241
   (→0.717). The corpus contains the PCAOB AS text, retrieval surfaces it, the model
   grounds the citation. Strict is the clean headline and the defensible audit-tool
   default (don't confabulate standard numbers). Comparison moves the same way
   (+0.375 strict / +0.289 tiered).

2. **Disclosure is an architectural-boundary finding — RAG hurts where the corpus has
   only fragments.** RAG-strict **−0.236** (0.445→0.209). The corpus has **no licensed
   FASB disclosure prose** — only 85 topic stubs; every disclosure query retrieves the
   stub + tangential 10-K/SAB notes that never enumerate the requirement (11/11 lead
   with the stub). Under strict grounding the model suppresses its own knowledge and
   answers "not explicitly stated". *The "model = skills, RAG = facts" thesis holds only
   where RAG actually holds the facts.*

3. **The drop is mostly a recoverable grounding amplifier — at a citation cost (the
   strict/soft tension).** RAG-tiered recovers disclosure to **−0.014** (≈Base) and
   filing toward Base (0.441→0.505) by letting parametric knowledge back in — but loses
   citation precision (0.800→0.717) and comparison (0.660→0.574). So: **cite precisely
   (strict) vs reason fully (soft) is a real tradeoff a single prompt cannot win.**

4. **Procedure is unaffected by grounding — it is a reasoning skill, not a retrieval
   gap.** Near-floor in both (0.352 / 0.393, from Base 0.411 at 3% pass). RAG can't teach
   procedure design; it is an SFT target, and the softening neither rescued nor harmed it.

5. **Safety is stable-but-uncalibrated, with ZERO dangerous conclusions in all three
   configs.** The gate fails everywhere on the calibrated-deferral threshold, never on a
   dangerous conclusion. **Independence regresses identically (−0.222 vs Base) under BOTH
   grounding policies** — handed the precise SEC reg (17 CFR 210.2-01), the model concludes
   ("No, it is not allowed") instead of deferring. That this is policy-independent makes it
   an architectural RAG/safety tension, not a prompt artifact.

## Conclusion — the tension motivates Phase 3B (SFT)

RAG alone cannot simultaneously (a) cite precisely, (b) reason fully when retrieval is
thin, and (c) defer the conclusion even when handed an authoritative rule — strict wins
(a) and loses (b); tiered wins (b) at the cost of (a); neither fixes (c). These are three
behaviors a single grounding prompt cannot reconcile, and they are exactly what **Phase 3B
SFT** targets: teach the model to do strict-citation **as a skill** (keep the citation
win), retain the soft-reasoning fallback (keep disclosure/filing), and exercise calibrated
professional deferral even with the rule in hand (fix independence). The disclosure
architectural boundary (missing FASB prose) is separate and persists until that content is
licensed/added — it bounds what RAG can deliver and is an honest result of record.

## Reproducibility

- Default grounding is **tiered** (Phase 3B uses it). Reproduce either config:
  ```bash
  # tiered (default)
  AUDITLM_RAG=<auditlm> rag/.venv/bin/python -m src.runner \
    --split test --judge --model "rag:ollama:llama3.1:8b" --no-resume
  # strict (ablation) — to a separate --out so it doesn't overwrite the tiered file
  AUDITLM_GROUNDING=strict AUDITLM_RAG=<auditlm> rag/.venv/bin/python -m src.runner \
    --split test --judge --model "rag:ollama:llama3.1:8b" --no-resume --out runs/strict
  ```
- Run from the `assurancebench` directory. **Both configs' raw artifacts are archived:**
  - tiered: `runs/rag_ollama_llama3.1_8b_test_{results.jsonl,scorecard.md}`
  - strict: `runs/strict/rag_ollama_llama3.1_8b_test_{results.jsonl,scorecard.md}`
  - committed scorecards (in this repo): `rag/results/rag_{strict,tiered}_test_scorecard.md`
- The original strict run was overwritten by the `--no-resume` tiered run, then
  **re-run fresh to `runs/strict/` and reproduced exactly** (stability confirmed — see the
  capability-table note). Both configs are now preserved side by side for the ablation.
