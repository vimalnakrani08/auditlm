# Phase 3B — SFT + QLoRA (Base + RAG + SFT)

Fine-tune Llama 3.1-8B (QLoRA) on audit-task demonstrations to teach the five target
behaviors from the Phase 3A findings (see [`rag/PHASE3A_RAG_RESULTS.md`](../rag/PHASE3A_RAG_RESULTS.md)),
then evaluate **Base + RAG + SFT** on the frozen AssuranceBench `test` split. Run ONE —
a first measurement, then decide on iteration.

## Target behaviors
1. **Cite precisely when grounded** (keep the citation win, never confabulate a number).
2. **Reason fully when retrieval is thin** (keep the disclosure/filing recovery).
3. **Defer the conclusion even with the rule in hand** (fix the −0.22 independence regression).
4. **Procedure-design reasoning** (base near-floor; RAG can't teach it).
5. **Disclosure knowledge as a skill** (corpus lacks FASB prose → must know it parametrically).

## Base model (apples-to-apples)
`meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct` — the same model the baseline serves as
`ollama:llama3.1:8b`. SFT trains a LoRA adapter on it; eval serves the merged result
through Ollama with the RAG layer (tiered grounding), so Base → Base+RAG+SFT is a clean
comparison.

## Fine-tuning stack — compute-flexible (decide at step 5)

**bitsandbytes 4-bit QLoRA is CUDA-only**, so the two paths differ by hardware:

| | **Local (M3 Max) — MLX-LM** *(recommended for run 1)* | **Cloud (A100/H100) — HF QLoRA** |
|---|---|---|
| tool | `mlx-lm` (`mlx_lm.lora`) — Apple Metal, the CLAUDE.md local FT tool | `peft` + `trl` SFTTrainer + `bitsandbytes` (or `unsloth`) |
| base | `mlx-community/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-4bit` (un-gated 4-bit) | `meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct` (HF-gated → license + `HF_TOKEN`) |
| quant | 4-bit base + LoRA (QLoRA-equivalent) | 4-bit nf4 base + LoRA (true bnb QLoRA) |
| cost / time | $0 / ~30–90 min, fits 36 GB | ~$1.5–2.5/hr × ~1–2 hr (<$20) + setup |
| friction | install `mlx-lm`, ~5 GB download | rent GPU, HF license, upload data |

Both train a LoRA adapter on Llama 3.1-8B Instruct; serving converges:
**fuse/merge → GGUF (llama.cpp) → quantize Q4_K_M → `ollama create auditlm` → eval
`rag:ollama:auditlm`**. Recommendation for run 1: **local MLX-LM** (zero cost, no gating,
matches the local-first ethos; ample for ~500 demos). Frameworks are installed at step 5
once compute is chosen — not now.

## Planned QLoRA config (run 1)
See [`configs/qlora_run1.json`](configs/qlora_run1.json): r=16, alpha=32, dropout 0.05,
target = attention + MLP projections; **2 epochs**, LR 2e-4 cosine, warmup 0.03, effective
batch 8 (1×grad-accum 8), **max_seq_len 4096**, **train on completions only** (mask the
prompt), seed 42, Llama-3.1 chat template. Modest by design — guards overfitting at this
data scale.

## Open design point for step 2 (demo format) — needs your call
To teach behaviors 1–3 (which are about *how to use retrieved passages*), the demos should
most faithfully match the deployment format: **input = the full grounded prompt (tiered
policy + retrieved hybrid passages + question), completion = the ideal answer.** The teacher
(Opus) sees the same grounded context the student will, and models cite-from-passages /
reason-when-thin / defer-even-with-rule in-context. (The lighter alternative — question →
answer with no passages — teaches answer style but not the in-context grounding behavior.)
I recommend the grounded-prompt format; I'll confirm with one pilot demo in step 2.

## Layout
```
training/
  README.md                 # this plan
  configs/qlora_run1.json    # planned hyperparameters
  data/                      # capability_demos.jsonl, safety_demos.jsonl (merged), train.jsonl
  scripts/                   # generation, corpus-verification, contamination gate, train, serve
  adapter/                   # trained LoRA adapter (gitignored — large)
```

## Build order (STOP after each)
1. **Scaffold + stack + config** — this. ← *current*
2. **Pilot** — ~20 capability demos (Opus + corpus verification), shown for quality check.
3. **Full capability generation** — ~300–500 demos, per-category + verification stats.
4. **Merge hand-curated safety file + CONTAMINATION GATE** (hard stop) — clean count.
5. **QLoRA training** — compute decided here; loss/hyperparams/adapter.
6. **Evaluate Base+RAG+SFT** — full test run + four-way scorecard + safety-gate verdict.

## Contamination (linchpin)
Capability demos are generated from the **task taxonomy + corpus**, never from the 166 test
items. The dev split (45) is **style-anchor only** (read for format, never trained on). The
contamination checker (shingle overlap vs all 166 test items) is a **hard stop before
training** — training cannot start until the set is verified clean.

## Honest framing
Distillation bounds capability **near (below) the teacher** — target is "close most of the
gap to Opus, run locally/cheap," **not** match Opus. **Safety is where we may EXCEED Opus**
(hand-curated deferral demos > the teacher's own deferral, which fails the gate).
