"""Benchmark-weighted, in-corpus, deduplicated seed pools for full capability generation.

Each seed is (task_category, topic). Topics are IN-CORPUS by construction: citation seeds
derive from the 51 PCAOB AS titles + curated ASC topics; the rest are curated audit subjects
that the corpus (PCAOB AS / SEC / FASB ASC topics / GAGAS) actually covers. The SCOPE
