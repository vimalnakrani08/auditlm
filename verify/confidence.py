"""Component 4 — confidence labeling (Phase 4 Verified-Citation Recommender).

Label each answer so the auditor knows WHERE to check. The labels describe citation
trustworthiness and deferral, NOT claim correctness:

  GROUNDED            every citation real & sourced (verified/base), nothing stripped.
                      "Here are the sources; check them." (Sources real — NOT "reasoning right".)
  PARTIAL             some real, some stripped, or base-only. "Scrutinize the flagged parts."
  GENERAL-KNOWLEDGE   nothing groundable (all stripped / no citations). "Verify before relying."
  DEFER               a professional-judgment zone (independence/fraud/legal/novel/tax): the
                      framework may be explained, but the CONCLUSION requires the firm's
                      independence office / counsel / specialist. Protective: applied even when
                      the model wrongly concluded.

No label implies the reasoning is correct — that is the false-reassurance failure we avoid.
