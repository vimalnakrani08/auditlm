"""Component 3 — the verifier (Phase 4 Verified-Citation Recommender). THE CORE.

Deterministic gate: raw model output -> annotated output + verification_report, where NO
fabricated citation survives in what is SHOWN. This is the property the whole phase exists to
deliver.

resolve() -> action mapping:
  GROUNDED_EXACT      keep, tag="verified", attach chunk_id(s)
  GROUNDED_BASE       keep base, tag="base_verified", append unverified-paragraph note
  OUT_OF_CORPUS_STUB  STRIP, replace with placeholder, tag="stripped"   (e.g. ASC)
  FAMILY_ABSENT       STRIP + flag                                       (AU-C/IFRS/IAS/ISA)
  UNRECOGNIZED        STRIP + flag                                       (fabrications, AS 9999.01)
  honest_disclaimer   keep untouched, tag="honest_disclaimer"           (behavior-5, from parser)

The honesty boundary (critical): the verifier confirms citation EXISTENCE, never citation
CORRECTNESS. tag="verified" means the cited paragraph is real and retrievable — NOT that the
surrounding claim is right (e.g. it cannot vouch that AS 2310.24 is the correct paragraph for
an A/R-existence procedure). GROUNDED_BASE goes further and explicitly flags the exact
paragraph/subsection as unverified — it must never vouch for the paragraph-level claim, since
that is exactly where the run-2 dangerous output lived (210.2-01(c)(3) cited for a (c)(1)
issue). Claim correctness is the auditor's check — that's "recommend, and they check".
